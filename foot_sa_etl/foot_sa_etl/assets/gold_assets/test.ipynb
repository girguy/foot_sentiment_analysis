Here are some of your comments: Liverpool fans Daniel: A bit slow and out of shape for the first 20 minutes of the game, which ultimately cost us a goal. But as soon as Diogo Jota scored, we started to find our rhythm again and the second half was much better. More clinical, more consistent and more productive going forward. Need to keep this momentum going as much as we can! Chris: The 5-1 win is fab and going forward we look great. I wish for more from Darwin Nunez but his work rate is great. The downside is that we conceded a sloppy goal, and even Bradley let too many people ghost by him. Caiomhin Kelleher was fab too with lots of good saves and he was very commanding. Callum: I had a feeling Liverpool would be at the races today. There’s a good group there that are dying to break into the first team and results like that are asking Slot the right questions. Come on you Reds. West Ham fans  Mark: Deserved losers, but like all our defeats this season, the scoreline flatters the opposition. It's nice we now have a manager who makes substitutions, but he keeps getting the team selection wrong. Michail Antonio should have started. James: Can’t help but feel hard done by. First goal looked like an offside in the buildup, second goal comes right after we should’ve had a penalty, third goal comes from a goal kick that should’ve been a corner to us. Fifth goal huge deflection. The scoreline did not reflect the game. Hoping some luck goes our way on Saturday. Richard: Another horror show. This is starting to get worrying. Going forward, at times it looks slick and promising but the midfield is just not working hard enough to protect the defence. Apart from Crysencio Summerville, the new additions are just not up to speed.</td>\n",

The first priority is to do it at the City Ground - that's where the team belongs and where the tradition is. \"We have a lot of supporters and a huge waiting list for season tickets. I'm sure a 50,000 [capacity] stadium would be full to watch the team.  \"This is important for the team, and most importantly for Nottingham. This is something I want to finalise, and have one of the best stadiums in England for years to come. This is my prime target right now.\" Marinakis also owns Olympiakos, who became the first Greek side to win a European trophy last season and he is eyeing continental football for Forest: \"Why not? We did it for the first time ever. We were the underdogs. Why not with Nottingham Forest? We have what is needed to go all the way, but the first target is playing well in the Premier League.  \"If Europe comes, it's something we will look to perform in.\" Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">There is never a dull day at Everton Football Club. No sooner were we absorbing Saturday's draw at Leicester City and seeing the return of Jarrad Branthwaite for the Under-21s, were we treated to a Monday that was far from blue and quite simply unbelievable. The saga of selling the football club has been well documented. Two years of false dawns, questionable suitors and scaremongering about bankruptcy have been the theme as Farhad Moshiri has looked to exit the club, seemingly unconcerned by the mess that may be left behind. This all made yesterday’s events even more remarkable. A little over 10 days ago, John Textor publicly declared he saw owning Everton as being comparable to having the keys to The White House. Fast forward to yesterday and The Friedkin Group agree a deal with Moshiri, leaving Textor out in the cold and Evertonians in raptures. The speed of the deal appeared to be as quick as the dazzling feet of Iliman Ndiaye. Murmurings of the Roma owners being back on the scene surfaced last week, but in all honesty, they never went away. Having already loaned the club £200m towards the stadium, many people felt the abrupt end to the proposed deal to buy the club over the summer was all part of the bartering process. A sense of relief greeted yesterday’s update. The Friedkin Group are the preferred suitors for many Evertonians and the much craved stability at the club is within touching distance. The information we’ve seen suggests the club could well move into Bramley Moore almost debt free, a far cry from the financial concerns that have been the back story of the club for what feels like an eternity. Obviously, there is still some work to be done but at last, the light at the end of the tunnel is almost blinding. Find more from Mike Richards at Unholy Trinity, external</td>\n",

Nicolas Jackson was zooming past West Ham’s defence at will without having to do anything particularly complicated. Was it his incredible pace or was it West Ham’s defenders simply being quite slow at this level? Probably a bit of both, but Jackson is seriously rapid, among the quickest in the league. Considering Chelsea’s midfield creativity, with his speed and just average finishing, Jackson could top 20 league goals this season, the accepted bar for a top striker on form. With Cole Palmer capable of doing at least as well after his 22 league goals last season, this would make them a real threat as a top-four team. Chelsea have lacked consistency since the ownership change - and even the consistency of the ownership appears to be under threat right now. But two trustworthy top scorers would be enough to get them to where they need to be. Sign up to read more from Nevin in his Football Extra newsletter here</td>\n",

Here are the key lines from his news conference: He was unable to give positive injury updates: \"The same players are out. [Willy] Boly is really close to joining the group. Unfortunately, Ibrahim Sangare and Danilo are out for a while. On Evangelos Marinakis' ambitions for the club: \"It drives everybody. He's the biggest authority in the club, so his ambition is what guides us. He wants to make this club grow and make it stable. If it [the City Ground] has 50,000, great. As long as it's here. That is what drives us. This goes from the owner to everyone at the training ground. Everyone has to commit themselves and be aware they are part of something that wants to grow. We need all on board.\" After being told his Forest side have had more 'direct attacks' than any other Premier League side this season: \"I think we are creating a lot of things [but] we still have to improve accuracy. Sometimes the last pass or finish isn't good. The idea reflects the stats - we want to go forward and attack.\" On the fixture schedule: \"We have to consider the people that decide the schedule. I know how hard it is to find dates, especially with the international dates. But we cannot forget the game is played by footballers and we have to respect the player. It's very difficult to play a game when you have less than 48 or 72 hours. If you repeat this over and over, then problems appear and the level of the game decreases. Let's try to protect the players.\" On Sunday's opponents: \"They are a very good team with good players and a good manager. They have started well. We have to compete very well with them.\" More on the Albion: \"Brighton make more offsides for their opponents than any other Premier League team. That shows how hard it is to play them. They are aggressive and have a lot of talent. They play possession football that is really difficult to play against.\" Follow all of Friday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news Listen to full commentary of Brighton v Nottingham Forest from 14:00 BST on Sunday on BBC Radio 5 Live</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">I could tell from Ollie Watkins’ body language as he walked into the interview room that his vibe was two points dropped rather than being satisfied with a draw away from home. Until Liam Delap’s equaliser, Aston Villa were set to go level on points with leaders Liverpool, and secure their best start to a top flight campaign since 1931. While Villa’s defensive frailties remain and it is 11 Premier League matches since Unai Emery’s side last kept a clean sheet, Watkins’ numbers show he is continuing to deliver on his established reputation for being one of Europe's most complete strikers. Four goals and two assists from the opening six league games is a career best return for the 28-year-old. Watkin’s described to me his one assist after the opening three matches as \"a bit of slow start,\" and then retracted his follow up of \"I’m finding my feet now,\" a statement he viewed as \"being too humble.\" He changed his stance, stating: \"I’m on a roll now so the goals are going to keep flowing.\" Such comments are more befitting of the elite aura he’s clearly keen to project. Any suggestions of Watkins coming across as arrogant were quickly balanced out by acknowledging the role of his team-mates as he added: \"The way the boys are playing and creating chances for me, it’s a dream to be honest. I’m looking forward to many more games and many more goals.\" Next up is the Champions League and Bayern Munich. Which, fitness permitting for the England captain, should provide the latest offering of the Harry Kane versus Watkins international debate which caught fire during the back end of Euro 2024.</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">The news that Yerson Mosquera's season is almost certainly over has added to the sense of the walls closing in on Wolves even at this very early stage. This is wretched luck for the player himself. For the second time since arriving at Wolves in 2021, injury has terminated his season in September, costing him an ideal opportunity for months of development at his highest level yet. It is also poor fortune for the club, further restricting Gary O'Neil's defensive options, although the feeling that they had taken a risk by failing to find a senior replacement for Max Kilman was already widespread. But it is too late to pick over transfer window decisions now. O'Neil's switch to a four-man defence rather than a wing-back system has been a regular discussion point but the injury to Mosquera does not necessarily shut off the option for a return to three central defenders. Should O'Neil want to revert to it to stem the flow of goals conceded, when Toti returns he would be a natural choice to Craig Dawson's left, while Santiago Bueno, Matt Doherty or Nelson Semedo could play to his right. At Villa Park, however, the tactical options were not really the issue. Wolves were rolling along happily enough for an hour in their current shape. The problem may be tricky to identify and therefore tricky to fix. Yes, Wolves were leading – and through a very well-taken goal – but in the second half you could sense in the stadium that they were growing less confident.  After the equalising goal, it was hard to escape the feeling that only one team seemed to believe they could win - and they duly did. This \"losing mentality\", as Mario Lemina called it recently, appears to have a hold on Wolves.  Shaking it off it is harder than talking about it, although that is probably the first step. Succeeding in the Premier League with – in relative terms – middleweight financial resources requires such clubs to occasionally upset the odds. Wolves have done this many times since promotion, but they must be convinced in their own minds they can do it again - for a whole game, not just a part.  Waiting for apparently easier games to come along will not be enough.

He added: “I’m very happy that these three players are in my team at the moment. “There are a lot of games to be played in this season, especially in the upcoming week and weeks so I’m very happy that I can select them and let’s see what the future brings.” Slot talked about how he is continually learning about his players and he’ll find out more about them in the immediate future with the trip to Molineux. The defeat by Nottingham Forest at home means he thinks his side have had a “good start, not a perfect one” and Slot will be hoping his side avoid another “setback” at Wolves.</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">We asked for your views on Dominik Szoboszlai's performances so far this season as number 10 for Liverpool, and whether Arne Slot should keep the Hungarian in that role or find another solution. Here are some of your comments: Luke: Szoboszlai does need to up his numbers. His work-rate is fantastic and he has the ability but his decision making is where he is lacking. For £60m I would be expecting more than one goal and one assist so far this season, especially when he is in a more advanced position than last. Tough decision ahead for Slot. Ilias: Totally agree. I would see Chiesa go into the number 10 position or in a 4-4-2 formation at the top. Matthew: Szoboszlai, at the moment, needs to be dropped. He is wasteful and a hindrance to the team currently. The return of Harvey Elliott cannot come quickly enough. Slot needs to be more ruthless with him as being inconsistent can only go on for so long. As a Liverpool fan, it's so frustrating watching him at the moment.  He is miles off it. Kenny: Dominik is so frustrating to watch. He has so much talent, the physique and the speed, yet he comes across as lackadaisical at times. His passing and finishing have been mediocre at best - and whether it is confidence or something else, he really needs to address it soon or he should no longer be considered an automatic starter. Evance: Why not play Mac Allister as number 10 and pair Szoboszlai with Gravenberch? It is that simple. Mac Allister is also more creative as a 10 than him.</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Everton manager Sean Dyche has paid tribute to legendary Nottingham Forest manager Brian Clough, who died 20 years ago today, at the age of 69. Dyche was an apprentice and young professional on the books at Forest between 1987 and 1990, and tells of recognising \"genius\" in the way Clough dealt with players, approached matches and set sides up tactically. \"When I became a manager, I started reflecting back,\" said the Everton boss. \"As a person and footballer, I learned so much during that period of my life. \"When the boss spoke, you were listening. He had this amazing thing that when he told you that you did well, you just felt 10ft tall and couldn't fit through the door, but if he told you that you didn't, you could go under the door with a top hat on.\" Clough did more than just try to mould Dyche as a footballer of the future, with a list of odd jobs also handed out to emerging players. Running a bath for Clough was a regular occurrence - with Dyche admitting he stressed about never knowing how hot to make it - while tending to the garden at the manager's house was also part of \"silly, mad stuff\" he would get up to. Not that it always went to plan for Dyche, who was almost always referred to as \"young ginger\" by Clough. \"He once asked me to get rid of five bags of leaves, green leaves,\" Dyche said. \"When I was a kid. I used to love a fire in the woods and I know green leaves are not going to burn very well. \"I'm at the bottom of his garden and he says: 'Young ginger, get rid of these leaves for me darling. I’ll help you start a fire and you can get rid of them for me'. \"He starts it off and goes back up, and he used to make us food - more food than you could imagine - so I'm putting these leaves on and thinking it isn't going to work. Then the wind starts blowing towards the kitchen and I'm going, 'oh no'. \"He comes out and says: 'Young ginger, get that smoke out my kitchen or I'm going to throw you on the fire'. \"I'm now putting one leaf on at a time and I have five bags, and I’m thinking this is going to be a long afternoon. And I hear him again and I say: 'But boss I can't help it, they are green leaves'. Then he went: 'You are right, well done' and just went back in. \"One minute I'm shaking, then I'm thinking he is all right now. \"As a character, he most certainly broke the mould.\" Watch Brian Clough - 20 years on, celebrating the man who put Nottingham Forest into football folklore</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Newcastle travelled to Fulham this weekend to take their first loss of the season. Remember last week when I asked you to give me a bit of leeway to gloat? This is why. Newcastle fans have seen this scoreline coming for a few games now - but bad performances have been masked by good results. The weekend’s game has meant that some fans are asking (albeit, quietly) is it time to ask questions of Eddie Howe? Howe has an enormous amount of goodwill with our fanbase. He was the first new manager under our new ownership, the manager that took us from nailed on relegation to 11th, then the Champions League. He seems to ‘get’ the region and the fans. Last season we did not have the results we wanted but we put it down to injuries, squad depth, bad luck. We have had the best start to the season since the mid-nineties, and yet there was a feeling of inevitability around Saturday’s game. It’s hard to point the finger at Eddie Howe for the reasons listed. So then does the buck stop with the players, some of whom are looking disengaged? Does it tie into the alleged tensions between head coach and board? Is it as simple as this team has gone as far as it can in its current iteration? I find that idea hard to believe. I also find it hard to believe that Howe, a man who by many accounts is obsessed with his work and making improvements, is not the person to take us forward. The problem is we have seen that performance before under Howe and opposition teams are working us out. Ultimately that blame does lie at his feet.  Our good start has provided a cushion, but he will have to find some answers soon. Find more from Charlotte Robson at the True Faith: Newcastle United Podcast, external</td>\n",

However, Fulham were unable to push on after they equalised with Silva waiting until the 77th minute to make changes. Timothy Castagne and Jorge Cuenca missed their spot kicks as Preston won 16-15 on penalties. It was the longest shootout in League Cup history, eclipsing the previous record set by Derby County and Carlisle in 2016 when the Rams won 14-13. Rodrigo Muniz blazed an effort over the bar and was unable to convert the rebound from Harrison Reed's fierce strike which came off the crossbar.

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Leicester City boss Steve Cooper has been speaking to the media before Saturday's Premier League game against Arsenal (kick-off 15:00 BST). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Cooper has no fresh injury concerns after Tuesday's Carabao Cup match at Walsall but defender Jannik Vestergaard remains unavailable for selection. He said he \"accepts\" criticism from fans after some boos were heard after recent games: \"I will always try to understand fans' perspectives and my initial reaction is not to be too defensive and see the rational of why the feeling is the way it is, and then try to do something about it. Supporters pay a lot of money and every supporter's reaction is authentic and you have to respect that.\" He sees it as a chance to respond: \"I see it as a good opportunity to show the real me, to show how well I want to do here and how strong I am as a character, and how good I am as a coach. When feelings are not as we want them I will try and take responsibility to change that.\" On the challenge posed by Arsenal: \"We're coming up against an incredible team who have been in great form for a number of years. In other seasons with the points they got they would have won the league. It's these games that you have to embrace with anticipation of succeeding and not fearing failure.\" Asked how the Foxes will approach the game, Cooper said: \"Everything in our game has to be right - on the ball, off the ball, game management, set-pieces - they’ve scored some important goals from set-pieces. Everything has to be close to perfect, including the mentality and belief. We need to be mindful of where Arsenal's strengths are but we have to back ourselves to deal with that.\" On improving performances: \"We know what it takes to play well. We know what it looks like tactically, technically. We're very clear on how the team plays, we train it every day. We've got to get consistency on our style of play. We do have a way of playing and sometimes we've not managed to reach the heights.\" Cooper says the core principles on what he wants from his team are: \"We want to play with the ball, exciting attacking football. We want to create overloads in certain areas of the pitch that allow us to hit the hotspots in a game that can hurt the opponents. Players through the middle in midfielders and number 10s and offering width from high full-backs or wide wingers. When we get through the lines we want enough players to continue the attack.\" Catch up on all of Thursday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news</td>\n",

Here are some of your comments: Richard: I've noticed the lack of patience with from fans, who are expecting instant success, after our run at the end of last season. We've lost a couple of first team players, bought in new players like Daichi Kamada, Maxence Lacroix, Ismaila Sarr and Eddie Nketiah. They need time to settle in, particularly the ones without Premier League experience. Keep the faith, people! Rich: Matches this season have felt like expectations will get us through matches. The end of last season was built on hard work, understanding the system and our pace when pressing. This season the energy is missing and while the new players are bedding in, they have not met the high standards the players we've lost set. I'm positive Oliver Glasner is the right man and we will improve. Bill: This time last year we were four points better off with a supposedly inferior side. I think it was wrong to sell Joachim Andersen and we should have cashed in on Marc Guehi. I don't think Kamada is any better than Jordan Ayew. I believe Jean-Philippe Mateta had a \"purple patch\" and will revert to the form he had in his first two years. I'm also unsure of Glasner's tactics. Martin: Have no clue why we sold Andersen. He was the rock at the heart of our defence and now we look vulnerable. That uncertainty has spread through the team. Selling Michael Olise was a given, but Andersen?? Matt: I think the winning run we had at the end of last season seems long gone. I'm seeing nothing of Palace this season like I saw last. Steve: Our passing accuracy has slipped this year. Our defence is looking vulnerable too. I was optimistic after the end to last season but my hope is slowly evaporating as replacements are not looking like enough for the Premier League.</td>\n",

The left-sided player set up Reiss Nelson's goal at Deepdale in his second start since returning to Fulham in the summer. \"He is getting better,\" said Silva of Sessegnon, who has not yet appeared in the Premier League this season. \"It was a very good game from him. From the first minute until the last minute, he kept composure, always up and down [the pitch], strong defensively and, of course, we know he is capable of being decisive with quality. \"It was not just the goal. Most of the chances we created came from his decisions in attack. \"He's going to be a really useful player for us. He already is, but he's going to be better and better.

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Mikel Arteta insists his friendship with Pep Guardiola will not be damaged as Arsenal aim to dethrone Premier League champions Manchester City. Following an ill-tempered and dramatic 2-2 draw between the sides last weekend, Arteta made clear that his \"personal relationship\" with Guardiola will not be affected by sport. Speaking ahead of his side's home match against Leicester City on Saturday, Arteta said: \"I love him, I respect him, I admire him and I admire his team and everything that he does. This is sport. One thing is our profession, another is our personal relationship.\" The Gunners have finished second behind City in the last two campaigns, finishing five and two points behind them respectively. \"If our relationship was damaged because one draws and the other one wins or the amount of times that they've beaten us, I would not talk to him any more,\" Arteta continued. \"So that's not our relationship, especially the relationship that I consider both of us have. In sport it will never get in my way, a personal relationship, that's for sure. \"The things that you really care about, make sure you handle them in the right way. That relationship I really care about.\" Arteta responded to criticism of the tactics he used against Manchester City, as his side played the entire second half with 10 men: \"If you don't like opinions then you shouldn't be sitting in the position that I am. It's quite simple. Don't take it personally. It's part of our job.\"</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">If there is a fixture that truly signals Aston Villa’s return to the Champions League, it is this week’s clash with Bayern Munich. The 2nd of March 1983 seems a long time away, when Juventus’s galaxy of stars - including Michel Platini, Zbigniew Boniek, and much of Italy’s 1982 World Cup-winning squad - provided the opposition the last time Villa Park hosted the competition. Having been a serial Europa League winner, Unai Emery has previously expressed his own ambition to win the Champions League. Interestingly, of all the clubs he’s managed, Aston Villa is the only one with its name already engraved on European football’s most prestigious prize. If Emery could take Villareal to the semi-finals in 2022, then Villa are a live dog in this tournament. In that very campaign, Emery’s team disposed of Bayern in the quarter-finals and Juventus the round before, so Villa’s upcoming fixtures against the same opponents will hold no fear for him. On Wednesday, Bayern may be the bookies' favourites, but Villa will not be the underdogs they were in Rotterdam in 1982. Last season, between the Premier League's four Champions Leagues qualifying teams, Villa held the best head-to-head record. This game, however, is about more than just Emery’s tactical acumen. It is a night for Aston Villa’s supporters and the players who were there when the club last lifted the European Cup in 1982. It feels like the story has come full circle, right on the club’s 150th anniversary.  For younger generations, who have endured some woeful seasons in the past decade, it is a first taste of what their club has the potential to truly be. While commercialisation increasingly exploits the emotions and history of the game - evident in the staggering Villa Park ticket prices - this match offers a rare, genuine connection to the past.  It is a night when fans can almost reach out and touch the legacy of 1982, and at the same time, witness a new chapter in Villa’s rich history unfold before their eyes.

Here are some of your comments: Dave: A glass half-full - some positive moments but at times we looked exposed and vulnerable against a poor Championship side. Need to be more clinical in front of goal and the passing tonight at times was shaky. But we are in the hat for the next round which is the main thing. William: We were very attractive and structured at the back, but Daichi Kamada and Jefferson Lerma struggled to link it through to the front three. If Eze doesn’t rescue us with a bit of magic, I’m not sure what the plan is really. Mike: It is becoming well known by coaches that we are not good at defending high balls into the box and QPR exploited that. Tyrick Mitchell is not playing well and some of our passing was way off as we continue to give away the ball far too easily. We did win, but we were not comfortable. We still have a lot to do and we must get better if we are go to survive Chris: Not good enough, simple as that. Us Palace fans are not asking for beyond our means. Ten years in the Premier League and we scraped past QPR with a near full-strength squad. One or two top-10 finishes when we’ve seen the likes of Wolves and even Sheffield Utd and Leeds come up and have enticing seasons. Yes, we’re known for exciting wing play, but results don’t show that. Rob: A really difficult watch. We gave up possession so many times and the whole performance was disjointed. The run of form at the end of last season seems a million miles away right now. Al: For all the possession throughout the game, we did not put the game to bed and that is something that needs addressing. Another game too, conceding early in the second half is a concern. Pleased for Eddie Nketiah getting his first goal but Thank goodness for Eze. Kamada in a central midfield role allowed him to show what an intelligent player he is.</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">The issue around the footballing calendar and the demands being placed on players right now is a difficult one. First, we need to take into consideration the really high demands on the body that go on all-year round with few breaks, especially for international footballers and those in teams competing on multiple fronts. I know the men's and the women's games are different, but we got exposed to these issues when we went from amateur to professional. There was a lot of loading, a lot of games and the result of that was a higher risk of injury and we have seen a lot of anterior cruciate ligament injuries now in the women's game. From the fans' side, their point is often that players get paid a lot of money but I think that is irrelevant. That is just the industry players are in and, if you take out the money, they are still human beings. The governing bodies need to look at who they consult with about changes in the calendar such as World Cups being held in winter and summers where there is just a couple of weeks off before going straight back into it. The changes and fixtures that are put in are there to generate more money, which makes it difficult. As a business, it is about money. We talk about mental health a lot and you wonder, where is the time to switch off and have that time away from playing? To have that family time which is a deep human need? At some point mentally, if not physically, it will take its toll. None of us want to see players striking, but players need to be listened to. What do they need to do to make change happen?

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Chris Sutton is making predictions for all 380 Premier League matches this season, against a variety of guests. For week six, he takes on Maximo Park singer Paul Smith, whose latest album, Stream Of Life, is out on Friday. Everton host Palace at 15:00 on Saturday. Sutton's prediction: 1-1 Crystal Palace are a very capable side on their day, but they have not been playing well enough recently. Everton boss Sean Dyche definitely needs a good result, and I am slightly worried about the atmosphere at Goodison Park if it turns ugly for whatever reason, and how the players handle that. I keep going for Everton home wins, and being wrong, so I am not making that mistake again. They keep taking the lead but it feels like they need to get Jarrad Branthwaite fit again if they are going to hold out. I actually fancy Everton here but without Branthwaite at the back I am not so sure they have got a clean sheet in them and, on that basis, I am going to say Palace will get a point. Smith's prediction: 1-1 Palace have looked bright on occasions without beating anyone, while Everton have gone in front in games and done well without seeing it out either - they have an attacking threat but they are fragile defensively and have completely crumbled in a couple of games. Their confidence will be low, so I’d say Palace have a good chance of nicking a win, but then neither team have looked very convincing to me. Read the full predictions and have your say here</td>\n",

Richard: A good victory for Chelsea. Their goals for column for the season is looking good. Nkunku delivers a hat-trick to put a bit of pressure on Jackson for a starting place in the Premier League. It is pleasing to see Gusto back, and the poorly treated Chilwell. How do you go from England full-back to unwanted so rapidly? Awaiting next opponent now. Colin: Played well considering the team have not had much game time. Chilwell did well when he came on. Overall performance quite good. Some of the passing still needs work. Playing out from the back is OK sometimes but slow and seems pointless. Overall a good performance. Hector: Barrow fans were excellent tonight, never stopped. Chelsea have phenomenal strength in depth. Mudryk needs to go on loan to Marseille and spend time with his mentor De Zerbi. Whisper it quietly but there's something great developing at Stamford Bridge. Ash: People will say in games like these they want to see more youth and academy players, but personally all I want to see is the team win convincingly no matter the opponent. This confidence will now spill over into our league form and players like Palmer and Jackson will work twice as hard knowing the 'second team' is breathing down their necks.</td>\n",

We are just waiting for the final result. Everyone saw the situation, It’s very difficult for a manager to control their emotions. It’s an emotional game with emotional situations. I had a chance to apologise for my behaviour and I think it was accepted. I’ll try not to repeat it.\" He is thrilled to be one of only four unbeaten Premier League teams so far: \"We are delighted with that statistic. We want it to continue and we have to work very hard to achieve it. It’s about how we want to progress as a team and what is important now is that every player is putting the team ahead of the individual.\" On Chris Wood's excellent recent form: \"He’s a top professional and a fantastic striker. It’s not only about the goals that he scores - it's his voice in the dressing room and what he means for the team and his team-mates. We trust him and I hope it continues.\" He knows Fulham will pose a tough challenge: \"Very difficult. Fulham are a good team with good players and a good manager. They are playing good, they are an offensive threat and they defend well.\" However, he is pleased to see Fulham striker Raul Jimenez playing and in form again. Nuno was the Mexico striker's manager when he suffered a head injury against Arsenal in November 2020: \"We are always delighted when we meet former players we have worked with. With Raul, it’s always special because of the incident and to watch him coming back and playing football is great. [But] he’s going to be our opponent and we have to be ready to stop him.

A much-changed Reds beat West Ham 5-1 in the Carabao Cup on Wednesday when a number of players staked a claim for more game time. Cody Gakpo scored a couple against the Hammers and, while Luis Diaz should come back for the top flight trip to Wolves on Saturday, the Dutchman is certainly pushing team-mate to keep performing. Diogo Jota also scored a couple against West Ham and, after Darwin Nunez started up front in the league win over Bournemouth last Saturday, the Portugal international might get the nod to start at his former club. Virgil van Dijk, Trent-Alexander-Arnold, Dominik Szoboszlai and Diaz did not play any part against West Ham so they are expected to return at Molineux.

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Manchester United may have shown glimpses of improvement in some areas in the early stages of the season, but football is a results business, especially in M16. And there is only so much that even the most patient of fans - a reputation I try my best to uphold, at least publicly - can accept. Back-to-back 3-0 league defeats at home is the definition of unacceptable. I could repeat the stronger adjectives I used on Sunday, but that is the part I will keep private. The official word is Ineos remains supportive of Erik ten Hag, who is expected to oversee this week's daunting trips to Porto and Aston Villa. That goes against the intensifying cries for change coming from an increasing number of fans tired of watching their team falter and fall while rivals triumph and thrive. Yet there is a key element many are forgetting, and it could be the core reason why Ten Hag was offered a third season in the dugout when Ineos was unconvinced in the first place. It boils down to financials. United recently made about 250 employees redundant as part of a ruthless cost-cutting process overseen by Sir Jim Ratcliffe. The club faced paying about £10m to terminate the final year of Ten Hag's contract in the summer. Now, after the decision to trigger the extension in his deal as a show of faith, he has 21 months left. Ineos can ill afford many more hiccups so early in what has been advertised as the start of a new era at United. Splashing what would now be as much as £18m to sack a manager months after backing him with another £200m in the transfer market would not be a good look. However, letting such glaring mediocrity continue could prove even more costly. It is a dilemma the next two matches will help answer. Find more from Alex Turk at Stretford Paddock, external</td>\n",

He's a super sub, the first time he touched the ball, he lobbed Neuer, one of the best goals in history.\" On the result: \"It's a statement, there's still a lot to play. We want to qualify in the first eight, in the top eight, it's one step at a time, we've got Bologna at home now in our second game, we are probably more relaxed but we want to win every game.\"</td>\n",

The 27-year-old has not been shy in admitting that he is \"dreaming\" of his first international call up with France and also said that the goal is \"in his head\" when he spoke to BBC Sport last season. Since that interview at the end of the previous campaign, Mateta scored five goals in six games at the Olympics in Paris to earn a silver medal for France, impressing then-manager Thierry Henry in the process. Since returning to south London, he has added to his tally with four goals in seven games for the Eagles. In 2024, he has scored 23 times in 33 games across all competitions for club and country. With former Arsenal striker Olivier Giroud now retired and Mbappe set to return after the international break, Mateta's chance is opening up. He will no doubt be watching closely when Didier Deschamps announces his squad next Thursday ahead of Nations League matches against Israel and Belgium.</td>\n",

The 22-year-old's form has been one of the major positives for Aston Villa in the first six weeks of the campaign and he was rewarded with a first club goal of the campaign in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Ipswich. There was a degree of fortune about how he received possession, but Rogers showed calmness to control Jacob Greaves' poor attempted clearance and then exchange passes with Ollie Watkins before finishing emphatically into the corner. There was also evidence of his exceptional ball-carrying ability in one second-half run when a succession of Ipswich tacklers tried in vain to dispossess him. Carsley has a wealth of attacking options to choose from but, on present form, Rogers may become increasingly difficult to ignore.</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">What makes a team truly hard to beat? Impenetrable defence? Suffocating press? Ruthlessness in front of goal? Or is it the persistence that they will always find a way through in the end? In the past two seasons, Arsenal have become a team hard to beat. Much of this has been down to their defensive discipline. Arsenal ended last season with the best defensive record in the league. David Raya is commanding, William Saliba and Gabriel imperious, the rotating left and right-backs seamless in slotting in. Leicester did not have a single corner on Saturday. But the 4-2 win presented another reason why Arsenal have become such a nuisance to take points off - their ability to win right at the death. It was not pretty, with Leandro Trossard’s wayward shot deflecting in and sending Emirates Stadium into raptures.  After peppering the Leicester goal for the majority of the second half, nothing would stop Arsenal in their attempts to clinch the win. That said, allowing Leicester back into the game might act as a small reminder that the Gunners are not flawless. Fans may still be haunted by games at West Ham and Liverpool two seasons ago when Arsenal twice let two-goal leads slip. As such, at 2-1, there were nerves in the crowd; nerves that Arsenal will be keen to nip in the bud, particularly against stronger sides than Leicester. Scoring winning goals in injury time can definitely be the mark of champions, but it did not need to happen in the first place. Why make it easy for yourselves when you could give the 60,000 watching at the ground - and the millions around the world - a mild heart attack? Please don't do that to us again, Arsenal!

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Don’t arrive late for a Brentford game! That must be the advice to Bees fans after we unbelievably scored after 22 seconds for the second successive Premier League match. Unfortunately, as at Manchester City the previous Saturday, the goal counted for little as we ended up losing away to one of the big six clubs –  but those goals certainly led to wild celebrations among the travelling support. The 3-1 defeat at Tottenham was very different to the City game, in which we dominated the opening 25 minutes after scoring. Spurs came right back at us and we became sloppy – passing straight to their players at least half a dozen times in the first half, with two of those errors leading directly to goals. It did not help that the defence had no protection, with Christian Norgaard, who led the side against Leyton Orient in midweek, missing with a minor injury. Without the captain’s presence, Spurs at times overran our midfield, so let’s hope Thomas Frank is right when he says he expects Norgaard to be fit to face West Ham this Saturday. The effect of his absence also backs up my point from the other week about how we need to tie down Norgaard to a new contract as soon as possible. We also had no focal point up front with the start of Yoane Wissa’s long injury absence, and it’s beginning to look a bit like last season. According to a list on the Premier League website, we already have more players out injured at the moment (seven) than any other club in the division. Time for the youngsters to shine.

You look at those names at the club and you think: 'Are they sure?' But you get there and Luis Fernandez was the manager.

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Wolves ended last season with only one win from their final 10 Premier League games and are winless in four league outings in 2024-25. Head Coach Gary O'Neil has said it is \"irrelevant\" to compare the end of last season with the start of this one and, given the changes in playing personnel and formation implemented, he has a point. But whether you look at the shorter or longer term, the statistics are far from ideal.  As with anything, context is key. Nine of the 14 games stretching across the two seasons were against teams that finished in the top half in 2023-24, while injuries to attacking players in the closing months of last term left Wolves' already threadbare squad down to its proverbial bare bones. Already this campaign, they have faced three of last season's top seven. They may only be averaging one goal scored per league game this season, but there are positive signs. Mario Lemina's well-worked goal against Newcastle showed what can happen when they get it right. According to Premier League statistics,, external seven \"big chances\" have not been taken - just six clubs have a higher total - and only Manchester City (four) have hit the woodwork more times than Wolves (three). It is at the other end where the major problems have arisen. Only Everton (13) have conceded more than Wolves' tally of 11 in four games this season. Some of those can be put down to Wolves' switch from a flexible back five to a back four, which has left them more open, but others are simply because of basic errors - Chelsea's Nicolas Jackson and Nottingham Forest's Chris Wood being left unmarked to head home from corners, for example. Looking ahead, things do not get much easier for Wolves. Three of their next four games are against Aston Villa, Liverpool and Manchester City - all of whom finished in the top four last season.  It may be during a slightly kinder run of fixtures during November and December when this team will truly be judged.</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">The consensus on Manchester United manager Erik ten Hag remains very much split among BBC Sport readers. Here are some of your comments: Daniel: Why always blame the manager? He puts out what he thinks is his best team only to be let down. Stop blaming the manager and blame the players who couldn’t care less. Start a rebuild with people who are proud to wear the jersey. John: This was another poor performance by United and the red card for Bruno Fernandes should not mask the inadequacy of the team's preparedness for this match. Ten Hag is out of his depth for a club like Manchester United. No idea, no team structure and no plan to recover from where we are. The new hierarchy should now show what they are made of and make the necessary changes. Steve: Why is everybody jumping on the bandwagon and clamouring for Ten Hag to be sacked? Let's just all calm down a bit here. Yes, they have been awful. Yes, the players look lost. However, it's early in the season with a lot of new players who will take a bit of time to gel together. No need for any 'Ta Ra Erik' banners yet. Keep the faith. Anthony: The club is a disaster. It all went wrong soon after Sir Alex Ferguson's departure because, I would say, they had not recognised the significance. How many times have they changed the manager? How much have they spent on star signings? New ownership, new management team and still the same look. Should Ten Hag go? Of course. He has not turned it around. John: I felt sorry for the situation at Old Trafford on Sunday. United had four new players in the team and lots still recovering from injuries. I have seen worse United performances over the years, including the year they got relegated. I would just sell Marcus Rashford and give the manager until the end of the year. I have supported since 1963. Paul: Embarrassing. No plan and no encouragement from the manager. I hate to say it, but Ten Hag is playing the same old way as last season! We need a change now - and not Gareth Southgate!</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">The issue around the footballing calendar and the demands being placed on players right now is a difficult one. First, we need to take into consideration the really high demands on the body that go on all-year round with few breaks, especially for international footballers and those in teams competing on multiple fronts. I know the men's and the women's games are different, but we got exposed to these issues when we went from amateur to professional. There was a lot of loading, a lot of games and the result of that was a higher risk of injury and we have seen a lot of anterior cruciate ligament injuries now in the women's game. From the fans' side, their point is often that players get paid a lot of money but I think that is irrelevant. That is just the industry players are in and, if you take out the money, they are still human beings. The governing bodies need to look at who they consult with about changes in the calendar such as World Cups being held in winter and summers where there is just a couple of weeks off before going straight back into it. The changes and fixtures that are put in are there to generate more money, which makes it difficult. As a business, it is about money. We talk about mental health a lot and you wonder, where is the time to switch off and have that time away from playing? To have that family time which is a deep human need? At some point mentally, if not physically, it will take its toll. None of us want to see players striking, but players need to be listened to. What do they need to do to make change happen?

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Former Southampton and Bournemouth defender Kevin Bond says he expects Monday night's south coast derby between the two sides to be a \"tight\" game. Saints are still searching for their first win since returning to the Premier League while the Cherries are looking to respond after back-to-back defeats at home to Chelsea and last time out at Liverpool. \"I think it will be tight,\" Bond told the Saints and Sinners podcast. \"With the exception of Liverpool, in all of Bournemouth's games they've been right in it. Five points from their first five games - they look all right for me to be fair. I thought the comeback against Everton after being two down was terrific. I thought that would have done them the world of good.  \"Sitting here right now I don't fear for Bournemouth, I do a little bit for Southampton though. It will be a tight game, they always are, and a good occasion. I wouldn't want to call it at the moment.\" As a player, Bond represented the Cherries in the old second and third divisions and went on to manage the club in League One and briefly in League Two between October 2006 and September 2008 during a period of deep financial struggle at the club which saw a series of heavy points deductions. Now an established Premier League team with aspirations of consistent top half finishes, Bond is impressed with Bournemouth's rise and believes they have possibly overtaken their South Coast rivals. \"It's remarkable where Bournemouth have come from,\" he said. \"But, through the previous and current owner, they have bought well, they pay players well and pay big money for them players. That doesn't necessarily guarantee you anything and Bournemouth have spent well.  \"It wasn't until recent years that Bournemouth have been, quite literally, in the same league as Southampton and now they've arguably overtaken them.  \"In truth, it is very much is a derby now.\" Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds</td>\n",

He was full of energy, even towards the end of the game, but there was maybe just a slight lack of quality with his shooting at the end [of his moves].\" Williams added: \"There was a real strength in Fulham's attack down that right-hand side against Newcastle.

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">There has been a lot of conversation this week about \"dark arts\" in football following the draw between Manchester City and Arsenal on Sunday. Realistically, everyone who has watched football for longer than one game has seen things they would perceive as \"dark arts\"; whether it is a player always going down winning free-kicks to take the sting out of the game, kicking the ball into row Z when there was no multi-ball system or time-wasting on goal-kicks. These are things we see all the time but our perception of it is dependent on the context of a game. You always see some version of it somewhere, and you hope your team would be doing the same thing if in the same situation - because why should you do something that would benefit the opposition you are against? It is the same as going down a bit more easily to win penalties - some people will say \"this guy is a cheat\", but then on the other side of their mouth, if it is something that could benefit them, they say \"he has tried too hard to stay up, he needed to go down there\". You can have rulings, Ifab can get involved to change this and that, but there will always be a way to push the rules to their limits. What we saw with Arsenal in that game, where David Raya sat down to get some treatment while the teams gathered, we have seen those moments before. It is not just new to Arsenal - other teams do it. It is always based on certain moments. You do get more frustrated if it happens against you, but when you need to do it, you encourage people to do it. That is one of the beauties of football - the way you see things is always going to be down to perception, context and just whether you think it is benefiting you or not.

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Hindsight is a wonderful thing and Wolves were not blind to their needs before the transfer window closed. Yerson Mosquera's serious knee injury, which is likely to end his season, leaves the squad even more stretched in a crucial defensive area.  A replacement for Max Kilman after his move to West Ham was key even before any injuries, but restrictions and availability hampered Wolves. After being beaten by Ipswich to the signing of Dara O'Shea, they looked at defenders, including Aston Villa's Diego Carlos but a deal never progressed from the exploration stage given the potential cost. West Ham's Nayef Aguerd also rejected a move to Molineux before heading on loan to Real Sociedad.  Other defenders in the Premier League were considered, so it was not for the want of trying or any lack of recognition of what they needed.  Boss Gary O'Neil has always been ready to play the cards he is dealt, although now his hand is weaker.  Liverpool come to Molineux on Saturday with Wolves still bottom and winless - although performances point to deserving better.  The crucial thing for O'Neil and his staff now is to continue to navigate the squad through a tough time and ensure morale does not dip. No internal panic buttons are being pressed and O'Neil feels reassured, but he is also sensible enough to recognise the sooner the wins come the better.</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Nuno Espirito Santo will be on the touchline when Nottingham Forest host Fulham on Saturday.  The manager was expected to be banned after he was sent off in Sunday's 2-2 draw at Brighton on Sunday.  But Forest have been given more time to submit their observations after Nuno and Morgan Gibbs-White were charged by the Football Association. They initially had until Friday but requested an extension and now have until Wednesday, 2 October.  Nuno has accepted the blame but is yet to accept the charge.  \"There’s always an answer and a response - we will respond to the charges,\" Nuno said. \"I think we deserve an opportunity to answer our view on the incident and we will do so as a club. \"It’s very difficult for managers to control their emotions sometimes. It happens with a lot of managers. It’s an emotional game, an emotional situation - sometimes it’s hard.  \"I had the chance to apologise for my behaviours. I think it was accepted. I will try hard not to repeat it.\" Nuno was charged by the FA with acting in an improper manner, with the Portuguese manager also alleged to have used abusive and/or insulting words towards a match official.  He was sent off after Gibbs-White was dismissed for receiving a second yellow card for a strong tackle on Joao Pedro with seven minutes left. The Key Match Incidents panel, which reviews the main decisions in the Premier League each week, was split 3-2, with the majority believing official Robert Jones was wrong to dismiss the midfielder. The England international has been charged by the Football Association with acting in an improper manner and/or using abusive and/or insulting words towards fourth official Anthony Taylor. Nuno already has a suspended one-game touchline ban - handed out in August - following his comments after Forest's controversial 2-0 defeat at Everton in April,which saw the club question the integrity of VAR Stuart Attwell on social media.</td>\n",

Speaking on the latest episode of The Devils' Advocate podcast, Drinkwater said: \"Are we ready to go through this again? \"We have seen this before and we are about to do it again. Third year, third season for a manager, a breakdown in the autumn, a sacking just before Christmas and rinse and repeat. \"I don't know what to do because I don't think Ten Hag deserves the job at the minute - but I don't know if I can go through this again. An interim manager comes in, they do well, the interim becomes the manager and in two seasons we sack him in October. Maybe it's something to do with the players. \"Ineos have a got a huge decision to make here but I think possibly it is the end of Erik ten Hag.\" Co-host Joe McGrath echoed Drinkwater's sentiments, however, he added he believes Ten Hag will be \"gone by the international break\". \"You have to be aware this manager is walking a tightrope as he should be after Manchester United's worst Premier League finish,\" McGrath said. \"But he's fallen off it now. \"I don't want people to think we are saying dramatic things for clicks and for people to listen - it's just how I feel now. \"He's got two games before the international break and he'll be gone by it.\" Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Liverpool are top of the Premier League. Ryan Gravenberch has been an absolute revelation - the best midfielder in the country this season. So it feels odd to write anything negative, but Liverpool have a slight issue at number 10 right now. Dominik Szoboszlai is in strange form. He works so hard off the ball for a player in an attacking position. His pressing from the front is elite - it is Roberto Firmino-esque. In possession, though, he has been creatively wasteful for a good few weeks now. The Hungarian has been consistently making bad decisions - either passing too soon, to the wrong player, or keeping the ball when it needed to be moved sharply.  Head coach Arne Slot hinted in an interview that he needs to do more in terms of goals and assists, so it has not gone unnoticed. When subbed off against Wolves on Saturday, Szoboszlai shook his head - but he had no right to be upset given he missed a sitter in the first half and failed to inject quality into our attack. Harvey Elliott is still injured, so Slot cannot even give him a rest, although Curtis Jones is an option at number 10 as well. Szoboszlai should not be written off, of course. He is only 23 years old and probably needs more confidence and composure to start making more things happen. He is very good off the ball, so I would argue he might end up being an option in the double pivot, with Elliott or a new number 10 eventually starting as the more advanced midfielder. Find more from Jordan Chamberlain at Empire of the Kop, external Do you agree with Jordan about Szoboszlai's form? Does Slot need to think about a change in the number 10 position and, if so, what is the solution? Have your say here, external</td>\n",

Here are some of your comments: Patrick: Our resilience; it was a key factor in getting us through our two promotions, (the vital late goals and making sure we didn’t lose games) and again shown last weekend at Southampton - it will be needed more than ever this season. Alan: I believe Ipswich are ahead of schedule to achieve the points required to survive this season. Two points achieved against top-10 teams and a point away against one of the seven teams in our own mini league. We will remain on track by reaching 12 points after the Leicester home game on 4 November. Joe: Ipswich Town need to put Sam Morsy’s statue outside Portman Road. Greatest club captain ever. John: One thing we shouldn’t be talking about is relegation. All this six pointer nonsense about the game against Saints. Last time we were promoted we finished sixth in our first season back. Not as good as finishing top in our first season back in the Sir Alf days. Can’t see us repeating those feats now, the game has changed, but less of the negativity. Tom: McKenna has always taken his time integrating new players. With time our many new players will learn the McKenna way and the team will get stronger as the season goes on. We also have Hirst returning from injury who is a real favourite of McKenna’s so expect him to start some matches over Delap in the coming weeks. Tim: Everything that surrounds the team shrieks out Premier League. The right to remain there will be fought out on the pitch. But the club’s history, the ground and training facilities, the fan base, the club culture, the local passion in Ipswich and Suffolk (and beyond) are all Premier League worthy.</td>\n",

Last 20 minutes they were stronger than us and we had to defend really well to maintain the point. \"We got into really good crossing areas and I was really pleased with how we were off the ball and how we attacked the game. I can't ask for much more than that, the lads gave everything.\" On Anthony Gordon playing up front: \"I've said he is capable of doing the role. The highlight for me today was his energy and his running. He led the line really well and really pleased that he got his goal. Well deserved.\" On Sandro Tonali: \"It's probably our strongest position in terms of choice. Joe Willock and Sean Longstaff we rate really highly. Tonali would be right up there with one of our best performers today. He suffered a bit of cramp today but that is natural with the amount of time out that he has had. On the improved performance from last week: \"It's difficult to define how people react in certain situations. There is always going to be a lift here, especially against the opponent. There's a fear factor, you know you have to perform well or it could be very difficult. The challenge for us is to find that consistency and that's what we are working towards.\"</td>\n",

Paqueta has struggled to make an impact since Lopetegui took charge of the Hammers following the departure of David Moyes, with his only goal involvement coming via a penalty in their 2-1 defeat by Aston Villa.

If you don't do that, the tactics always fall down anyway.

Forest also had James Ward-Prowse just sitting in front of their back four ticking things over and Ryan Yates alongside him getting on everyone's nerves with his tenacity. Their substitutes came on and impacted the game at Anfield as well and the whole team had such composure. So, while I look at Brighton and think they are capable of scoring, based on what I saw from Forest, why would I say they will lose? I don't think Brighton will lose at home either, so I am really sorry, but I am going to have to go for another draw.

Because we have so much quality, we can create assists or goals.\" He said the players \"understand they can't play every game unless it is absolute necessary\" because of the number of competitions they are in. On Luis Diaz, who has scored five goals so far this season: \"It is still a small sample size. Maybe he was a bit unlucky last season but a player of his quality will always score a lot of goals.\" He said the team \"need to do better\" on their \"collective idea\" around defending and not conceding as many chances per game. On what he has learned so far: \"I learn day by day about the players. We haven't faced many setbacks yet and you always want to learn how the team and players react to that.\" He said it \"has been a privilege to inherit a squad like this\" and praised \"the culture that Jurgen [Klopp] left behind\". On opponents Wolves, who go into the game bottom of the Premier League: \"I don’t think it represents how they have played as they have had very difficult fixtures and you have to take this into account.

Sutton's prediction: 2-0 Are we going to see Arsenal park the bus again? It was more like a couple of buses than just one in front of their goal against Manchester City. There is a lot of attention on Gunners boss Mikel Arteta and his approach, and whether people view his team as too negative - they were also very defensive against Atalanta in the Champions League last week - but it's what happens in the end that counts. If this is all part of a long-term plan and Arsenal end up winning the Premier League, then you have to take your hat off to Arteta. In any case, I'm expecting them to be much more attack-minded here. There was a bit of negativity towards Leicester boss Steve Cooper from Foxes fans when their side got past Walsall on penalties in the Carabao Cup on Tuesday, but they need to be patient with him. I always felt it was going to be very difficult for all three promoted clubs this season, and I predicted they would all go down, just like all three did last time. Leicester have had great success in the Premier League previously, finishing fifth two seasons running in 2020-21 and 2021-22 after winning it in 2015-2016, but their circumstances are completely different now. Right now their season is all about their struggle to stay up. Losing Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall to Chelsea in the summer was a big blow because he knitted everything in midfield and, as a team, I would say they are a work in progress. The problem for Leicester is you don't want to be playing Arsenal when you are a work in progress. This is going to be an extremely tough afternoon for them, and I can't see them getting anything at the Emirates. Smith's prediction: 3-0 Leicester are up against it this season, for sure. Arsenal are going to be dominant and once one goal goes in, another couple will follow. Read the full predictions and have your say here</td>\n",

Asked how much of his work with his players this season will be about psychology, Martin said the \"psychological game is the most important bit\". He later added: \"I'm learning more all the time about the group and we're learning more about what's required at this level. I hope, in the five games we've had, they have enough to know that to feel fear of the Premier League, certain players and teams is completely natural - but you have to embrace it and really seize the opportunity we have. I feel more and more that they are doing that and the results will follow.\" Martin said teenager Tyler Dibling's \"ceiling is so high\" if he continues his current rate of progression: \"He has an incredible belief in himself, in a humble, modest way. He has to just keep giving 100% and understand what has got him this far. At this moment he couldn't play for every team, he suits the way we play a lot, and he's getting so much better at the stuff he needs to improve on.\" Martin added: \"He needs to continue to grow and develop and stay so hungry - that's always a challenge with young players when they have a quick rise. With Tyler, I don't see that being a problem.\" Saints boss Martin said of Monday's opponents: \"Andoni Iraola has done a brilliant job, but it took him some time, in the same way it has taken us a bit of time to adapt and adjust. They had a bumpy start under Andoni but they've been brilliant ever since and they've kept building on it.\" On the local derby element of the match, Martin added: \"The fans will be desperate for us to go there and put in a performance, but not just because of the locality of the team we're playing against - we want to win. I haven't been given any extra motivation by anyone here and I haven't placed any extra onus on the game because of that.\" Follow all of Thursday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news</td>\n",

We needed an extra midfielder in there to make sure we had cover. \"An adjustment we needed to make - Lucas will get plenty of opportunities.\" On Brennan Johnson's goal: \"Brennan's was great. \"With 10 men we still pressed which is what we wanted to do. \"He has some confidence in him which is great - we need him! \"We knew if we win it [the ball] Brennan and Sonny [Son] would have the space. \"I wanted to get Dejan [Kulusevski] on as he runs hard and I felt we would need some legs in the second half, Brennan is fine.\" On Pape Matar Sarr's goal: \"I felt we needed a second. We worked hard on our set-pieces. It's great for Pape [Sarr] who I thought was great today. \"Pape took his goal well and that's his first 90 minutes for us this year and he played strong.\" On Dominic Solanke: \"He has been great for us Dom. He went through that long drought of two games without a goal! \"He has been fantastic for us not just goals, but his link-up plays. He is a typical striker. \"He is still working his way back to full fitness.\"</td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Tensions were laid bare for Leicester on Tuesday.  Their 3-0 penalty shootout win over Walsall, following a 0-0 draw, sent the Foxes through to the fourth round of the Carabao Cup.  Yet, struggling to break the League Two side down, a section of supporters directed negative chants towards boss Steve Cooper urging him to \"sort it out\" with a fan also running onto the pitch, gesturing at the dugout before being escorted off. From his first day, when he wrote an open letter to supporters, Cooper has strived for unity, while he has invited legends like Matt Elliott and Gerry Taggart into the training ground to soak up their knowledge of the club.  He has looked to get under the skin of the Foxes but, after Tuesday, it appears he has yet to break the surface with some of the fanbase.  That is not something Cooper has ignored - he spoke following the shootout about needing to build credit with supporters and owning any chants at him.  Putting Saturday's visit to Arsenal aside, the next two home games against Bournemouth and Cooper's former side Nottingham Forest, either side of a trip to Southampton, are likely to go a long way to determining the opinion of the paying fans.  Regardless of this being a different era for Leicester - following their title winning and Champions League exploits - there is always an expectation to get results, even if Cooper has only had five league games with a new squad.  Few newly promoted sides fly up the league, especially ones who lost their manager and star man when both Enzo Maresca and Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall left left for Chelsea. Managers always need time, though it is the one commodity rarely afforded to them.  And Cooper is no different. </td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Seven and a half years. That’s how long it was since Fulham recorded a win against Newcastle. That period of time spanned nine games, during which we drew only twice, scored just two goals - and lost the last six in a row. Marco Silva oversaw five of those defeats. It must have felt good for our gaffer to finally get one over Eddie Howe; you’d have to scour the record books to find a bigger bogey manager for Marco. The win on Saturday was emphatic - and banished the disappointment of our late switch-off against West Ham. On paper, if you’d swapped those two results and offered them to Fulham fans we’d have all been delighted. Eight points from our opening five games, unbeaten at home, and just one defeat - on the opening day - constitutes a fine start to the season. And what’s more; it was a near-flawless day in the autumn sunshine at Craven Cottage. The club had two main targets in the summer window: they wanted to bring Emile Smith Rowe in once it was clear there was a chance to do so, and the club recently revealed to the Fulham Supporters Trust that they were also determined to bring Joachim Andersen back to the club, identifying him as “a potential future club leader”. ESR bagged his second goal of the season and Andersen put in another towering performance at the back. Strong recruitment, then. Stronger still when you consider that former Arsenal team-mate Alex Iwobi provided the assist for Smith Rowe, while former Wolves comrades Adama Traore and Raul Jimenez linked up in the first five minutes to send us on our way. Assembling successful puzzle pieces from other Premier League clubs is proving to provide a strong foundation for this Fulham side. We all know how easy it is to get carried away, but after scratching our seven-year Newcastle itch and creeping into the top eight, whisper it quietly: things are looking pretty rosy in SW6.

Here are some of your comments: Newcastle fans Philip: Best performance of the season so far. The team showed the hard work and tenacity which has been missing in some games. Onwards and upwards. Richard: Most Toon fans were expecting a hiding today even if they didn’t say it out loud. I thought we’d draw and for once I was right. I expected a reaction from the Fulham game and I expected us to up our game in the face of City. City had their injury issues but then so did we - we have Isak and Botman out remember. So, a performance to build from. Andrew: Absolute night and day from the Fulham performance. Every single player put themselves on the line and gave everything. If we keep this level up then we're only going to get better. Fen: The best performance so far this season. Everyone played so well - a proper team performance. We were definitely missing a prominent striker today but any player on the park looked like they could have had a chance today. Anthony Gordon is looking strong and our midfield stood up to the challenge today. Massive performance, well done lads! Man City fans Phil: Nick Pope saved the day with an unbelievable stop as City nearly pinched it at the death. Eddie Howe’s Newcastle are always formidable opponents, particularly at home and a point may be invaluable at the end of a long season. Neil: Walker has cost us a goal in each of the last three matches. It is time he was rested and maybe replaced with a more accomplished full-back who has the game presence to realise when someone is behind them and not to play the opposition on-side. Martin: In a league so tight where other teams have caught up with City, dropped points will be detrimental. What is concerning is the ease that other teams have in scoring. Only two clean sheets all season. We don't have a rock solid defence or if we do, they are not concentrating enough. We can't afford to waste chances either. More clinical please. Alan: Tough game so soon after Arsenal but held their own and again had to deal with defensive tactics and sharp tackles. Penalty was 'made' by Gordon and poor Haaland was subdued by a compact defence. Referee had a poor game allowing some fouls and then being picky for periods of time. Best player was Gvardiol, while Newcastle's was their goalkeeper.</td>\n",

Both yellow cards were just ridiculous tackles in areas of the pitch where he doesn't need to make them. \"He's cost his team and he's put a lot more pressure on the manager because I think the performance in the second half, in elements, showed a little bit of fight and quality. To do that and then collapse at the end heaps the pressure on even more. \"Defensively, they haven't been sound. They are struggling and it needs something to bring it together. It needs a partnership in that area of the pitch. I'm not too sure if that's going to happen any time soon. \"There's a little bit of uncertainty in full-back positions, and when you're up against it with 10 men, you're defending in front of The Kop and you're disappointed because you should be back in the game... that's when it really gets tested. \"It leaves a really dismal feel about the evening and there were some positives in this game, unlike against Chelsea.\"</td>\n",

Chivers played over 200 games for Albion and made over 100 appearances for Chelsea. Ahead of this weekend's game he has been speaking to the Albion Unlimited podcast about Maresca's team and said: \"He's changed the style of play - and now they're playing ever so well. \"The game against West Ham the other day - what a result, the way they played was unbelievable. He gets the full-backs tucking into the midfield, so when in position it's really hard to get the ball off them. \"He's settled in now, they know what he wants and they're showing it when they play, because they're playing awfully well at the moment - it's a tough game for Brighton to go there and get a result.\" It will be a re-union for a number of former Brighton players, including Ecuador midfielder Moises Caicedo, and Chivers praised the 22-year-old with how he's started the season. He added: \"Caicedo has been out of this world - his actual play has been unbelievable.  \"He got a bit of stick, and rightly so because he was playing in a team that lacked a bit of confidence when he joined. Against West Ham he was awesome.\" Another Chelsea player who has started the season in good form and scored two goals against West Ham recently is Nicolas Jackson. \"When he first came to the club, he got a little bit of stick - rightly so again.\" Chivers said. \"The way he's playing at the moment, he's confident, he took his goals really well and he looks the real deal at the moment - he's progressing brilliantly. \"Maresca likes him to come out wide and then he's going in the middle. He's playing all over the shop.\"  Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds</td>\n",

The Nottingham Forest boss was sent off in the 2-2 draw at Brighton on Sunday in the aftermath of Gibbs-White's dismissal.  The England international walked after being given a second yellow card for his 83rd-minute challenge on Joao Pedro.  The pair have been charged by the Football Association for their reactions but Nuno will be on the touchline for the visit of Fulham on Saturday after Forest were given until Wednesday [2 October] to present their observations.  Nuno said at the start of the season he trusted the officials - after Forest's high profile issues last term - and Sunday's red cards has not changed that. \"Not at all. We are positive there has been a big effort from referees to improve and make things right and not influence the game,\" said Nuno, who confirmed he apologised to the officials for his reaction after the game.  \"We trust them and are here to support them. But the game is the game. \"Up until today I saw the image many times and I'm not sure sometimes. It looks like a yellow card sometimes, others it's a good tackle. It's a hard one to judge. \"That's why I think us as a club and all the clubs should support the referee as it's a tough task. \"It's very difficult. In that moment Morgan made that effort for the team. \"We were unbalanced, knowing that any goal in that particular moment of the game would be definitive. It's emotional, we are under a lot of stress.\" The Key Match Incidents Panel was split 3-2 over Gibbs-White's red card with the majority believing official Robert Jones was wrong to issue a second caution. But Nuno conceded the confusion, after referee Jones signalled with his hands Gibbs-White - who will miss the visit of the Cottagers - won the ball, did not help. \"That was the mess. But let's hope they improve and we continue,\" he said, with Forest unbeaten in their opening five Premier League games.  \"I don't want to see it as a problem. I see it as a very hard job to do.\" </td>\n",

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">In January 2001 Mikel Arteta left Barcelona for Paris St-Germain in a move that would ultimately help transform one of the most intelligent midfielders of his generation into one of the game’s top coaches. It was where he first displayed the leadership qualities that have seen him progress to Arsenal manager and he will welcome PSG to Emirates Stadium on Tuesday in the Champions League. The 18-year-old Arteta, faced with the impossible task of usurping the likes of Pep Guardiola, French World Cup winner Emmanuel Petit, Dutch international Phillip Cocu and Xavi Hernandez in Barcelona’s star-studded midfield, had moved to the French capital on an 18-month loan deal. PSG were yet to become French football’s dominant force but had progressed to the second group stage of the Champions League and boasted several big names of their own, including Jay-Jay Okocha, Nicolas Anelka and Mauricio Pochettino. A young Brazilian by the name of Ronaldinho would join the club from Gremio later that year. Arteta barely spoke any French, but a small contingent of Spanish speakers helped him settle quickly into life in Ligue 1 and despite his tender years, the teenager made a big impression at the Parc des Princes.

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">There has been a lot of conversation this week about \"dark arts\" in football following the draw between Manchester City and Arsenal on Sunday. Realistically, everyone who has watched football for longer than one game has seen things they would perceive as \"dark arts\"; whether it is a player always going down winning free-kicks to take the sting out of the game, kicking the ball into row Z when there was no multi-ball system or time-wasting on goal-kicks. These are things we see all the time but our perception of it is dependent on the context of a game. You always see some version of it somewhere, and you hope your team would be doing the same thing if in the same situation - because why should you do something that would benefit the opposition you are against? It is the same as going down a bit more easily to win penalties - some people will say \"this guy is a cheat\", but then on the other side of their mouth, if it is something that could benefit them, they say \"he has tried too hard to stay up, he needed to go down there\". You can have rulings, Ifab can get involved to change this and that, but there will always be a way to push the rules to their limits. What we saw with Arsenal in that game, where David Raya sat down to get some treatment while the teams gathered, we have seen those moments before. It is not just new to Arsenal - other teams do it. It is always based on certain moments. You do get more frustrated if it happens against you, but when you need to do it, you encourage people to do it. That is one of the beauties of football - the way you see things is always going to be down to perception, context and just whether you think it is benefiting you or not.

In what has been a fine start to the season for Villa - Unai Emery's side have taken 13 points from their first six Premier League matches - Rogers' performances have been a major positive. Playing in a central position behind the main forward, Rogers' understanding with striker Ollie Watkins is developing week by week.

Against Ipswich, Rogers calmly collected from Jacob Greaves' poor clearance, swapped passes with Watkins and fired into the bottom corner to score his first Premier League goal of the season. However, for those unsure or unaware of Rogers' ability at the top level, it was his display in Villa's 2-0 defeat by Arsenal on 24 August which perhaps did most to bring his talents to wider attention. Carsley chose not to include Rogers in his squad for September's Nations League games against Republic of Ireland and Finland. Instead he was selected for the Under-21 side, a decision which \"surprised\" Villa boss Unai Emery, external, who said Rogers was \"not a player for the second team\".

       "    <td class=\"gt_row gt_left\">Tottenham began their Europa League campaign with an entertaining victory against Azerbaijan side Qarabag, despite going down to 10 men in the first seven minutes. There were plenty of positives for Ange Postecoglou. Not least a convincing win on their return to Europe after a year-long hiaitus. Valuable minutes for his young players, a clean sheet despite being down to 10 men and confidence-boosting goals for summer signing Dominic Solanke as well as Brennan Johnson, who reportedly deactivated his Instagram account because of criticism received in the wake of his club's derby defeat to Arsenal earlier this month. But Spurs' all-out attacking style often leaves them vulnerable to the counter-attack. Qarabag must have wondered what else they needed to do to find the net as the wasteful Juninho had a goal ruled out for offside, Toral Bayramov went close several times and Vicario produced a brilliant save to deny Elvin Cafarquliyev's long-range strike. The sight of Son Heung-min hobbling off in the second half could also be a concern as Spurs face Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday, before a trip to Hungary to face Ferencvaros next week.</td>\n",
